                    <p id="firstText"> The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally
                        in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by way of television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous
                        genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. It consists of an ideal story-telling
                        mechanism, combining graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings
                        as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides an ideal path for escapism that audiences can immerse
                        themselves into with relative ease. Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large emotive or realistically sized eyes.The anime industry consists of over
                        430 production studios, including major names like Studio Ghibli, Gainax, and Toei Animation. Despite comprising only a fraction of Japan's domestic film market, anime makes up a majority of Japanese DVD sales. It has also seen
                        international success after the rise of English-dubbed programming. This rise in international popularity has resulted in non-Japanese productions using the anime art style, but these works are usually described as anime-influenced
                        animation rather than anime proper.</p>

                    <h3 id="second">Second Generation of Anime</h3>
                    <p id="secondText">Prewar animators faced several difficulties. First, they had a hard time competing with foreign producers such as Disney, which were influential on both audiences and producers. Since foreign films had already made a profit abroad,
                        they could be sold for even less than the price domestic producers need to charge in order to break even. Japanese animators thus had to work cheaply, in small companies with only a handful of employees, but that could make matters
                        worse: given costs, it was then hard to compete in terms of quality with foreign product that was in color, with sound, and made by much bigger companies. Japanese animation until the mid-1930s, for instance, generally used cutout
                        animation instead of cel animation because the celluloid was too expensive. This resulted in animation that could seem derivative, flat (since motion forward and backward was difficult) and without detail. But just as postwar Japanese
                        animators were able to turn limited animation into a plus, so masters such as Yasuji Murata and Noburō Ōfuji were able to do wonders in cutout animation.Animators such as Kenzō Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, however, did attempt to bring
                        Japanese animation up to the level of foreign work by introducing cel animation, sound, and technology such as the multiplane camera. Masaoka created the first talkie anime, Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka, released in 1933, and
                        the first anime made entirely using cel animation, The Dance of the Chagamas (1934).Seo was the first to use the multiplane camera in Ari-chan in 1941. Such innovations, however, were hard to support purely commercially, so prewar
                        animation depended considerably on sponsorship, as animators often concentrated on making PR films for companies, educational films for the government, and eventually works of propaganda for the military. During this time, censorship
                        and school regulations discouraged film-viewing by children, so anime which could possess educational value were supported and encouraged by the Monbusho (the Ministry of Education). This proved important for producers that had
                        experienced a hard time releasing their work in regular theaters. Animation had found a place in scholastic, political and industrial use.</p>

                        <h3 id="action">Action</h3>
                        <p id="actionText">The action genre is characterized by a lot of movement of the characters. Dialogue is often brief and composed of interjections, battle cries and shouting character names. In this sense, the action genre can be useful for trying to pick up words.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 id="comedy">Comedy</h3>
                        <p id="comedyText">Probably the most verbose of all anime genres, the comedy genre is characterized by jokes, obviously, usually in the a real-life setting.Pacing of speech is relatively fast, but more relaxed than action. Japanese anime jokes go four ways: the clean jokes, the dirty jokes (mostly sex jokes), parody jokes and the rom-com (romance/comedy).</p>

                        <h3 id="drama">Drama/Tragedy</h3>
                        <p id="dramaText">Drama and tragedy anime consist of intensely and passionately spoken lines, usually with emphasis on emotion. In that sense, this genre can be very useful to study extreme ways of speaking Japanese to convey your intent, as more than half of speaking Japanese isn’t so much about what is said, but rather how it’s said and reading between the lines (and some body language).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3" id="historyG">
                        <h3 id="history">History</h3>
                        <p id="historyText">History anime all have settings from past times. The idea of studying history anime is much like reading Shakespeare in English class; it may not seem beneficial, but at advanced levels, there will be greater comprehension and better adaption to the language.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 id="mecha">Mecha/Military</h3>
                        <p id="mechaText">Mecha is characterized by the presence of science fiction robots, while the military genre features uniformed military as the main characters. These usually come hand-in-hand, as seen in series such as “Gundam” and “Macross.” While they make interesting shows, they don’t provide much practical vocabulary or language, and unless you’re going to join the military and need to learn some Japanese, there’s no point in knowing the meaning.  I would not advise watching this genre to learn Japanese.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3" id="supernaturalG">
                        <h3 id="supernatural">Supernatural/Magic</h3>
                        <p id="supernaturalText">Supernatural and magic anime have phenomena that cannot be described scientifically. To keep it simple, such works (especially in fantasy) tend to focus too much on describing the fictitious setting, and leave very little – if any – room to study vocabulary and language use effectively. Again, I would not advise watching this genre to learn Japanese.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3" id="romanceG">
                        <h3 id="romance">Romance</h3>
                        <p id="romanceText">The romance genre always involves… love. It comes in many forms, such as the pair that never comes together until the end, the love triangle where two fight over the same person and the love square+ (anything that’s four or more people, where everyone is fickle enough to switch feelings on a dime). Note that I do not include rom-com in here, since the emphasis of those shows is the comedy, which is all the more evident in the tone of voice and vocabulary of the characters.Everyone needs a little lovin' in their life. Whether it's a casual fling or full blown love-of-your-life type scenario, it's good to let people in every now and again.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3" id="psychologicalG">
                        <h3 id="psychological">Psychological</h3>
                        <p id="psychologicalText">The psychological genre usually focuses on the mind of each character. Some sub-genres of this include horror, philosophical and mystery. Generally speaking, this genre has a tendency to use many of those advanced vocab words composed of two or more consecutive kanji) and rather difficult concepts such as paradoxes and thought experiments. For the more advanced learner of Japanese, this is a perfect opportunity to expand on vocabulary and find ways to apply them using the examples provided in the dialogue.</p>
